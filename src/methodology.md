## Methodology

1. Data processing
2. Data cleaning
3. Literature Review

- Development of this SCARED
  - What are the type of analysis being done?
    - How are they interpretated?
- What are the Gaps and Promises?
  - Understanding the Discrepancies?
  - Understanding the Symptom Networks?

4. Analysis
5. Individual page

- Discrepancy Analysis
  - Anxiety Scores: Child Vs. Parent
  - Mean scores by disorder and reporter
  - Child vs. Parent Total Scores with Discrepancy Analysis

- Individual Symptom Network
  - Individual Parent Child Persception shown using the Spider Chart
  - You get personalized
- Overall Symptom Network

6. Network Analysis: Understanding the interaction between Symptoms

- SCARED symptom Network Visualization
  - Nodes represent individual symptoms
  - Edges show the strength of connection between symptoms
  - Thicker and Darker edges = stronger relationships

- Randomness & Replicability
- Robustness and Intervention Simulation
- Symptom Network + LLM Interpretation

## Index

- Can we build an index for arc diagram showing the network of symptoms
- Arc Diagram Showing the Network of Symptoms

  - Overall Bridges.
  - Hubs.
  - Robustness of the Graph
  - With a low sample of the Data. How reliable this graph is?
